### 6.2 Security Considerations
- All data transmitted via **HTTPS (TLS 1.3)**.  
- **JWT-based authentication** for API access.  
- Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) for Admins, Brokers, and Users.  
- Encrypted storage for sensitive user data.  
- Security logging and audit trails for all major system actions.

## 🔐 8. Security & Compliance

| Area | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Transport Security** | HTTPS (TLS) enforced on all routes. |
| **Data Protection** | Sensitive data hashed (bcrypt) or encrypted (AES). |
| **Input Validation** | All user input sanitized to prevent XSS, CSRF, and SQLi. |
| **Access Control** | Role-based access via JWT + scopes. |
| **Audit Trails** | Logging for login attempts, listing edits, and payments. |
| **Fraud Prevention** | Pattern detection for repeated scam attempts. |

## 🚀 10. Getting Started (Development Setup)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/key2key.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd key2key

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

## ⚙️ 10. Environment Variables

To configure the system securely, the following environment variables must be defined in a `.env` file within the project root.

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the PostgreSQL or MongoDB database. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used for signing and verifying authentication tokens. |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | Cloudinary API endpoint for secure media storage and delivery. |
| `CHAPA_API_KEY` | API key used for integrating the Chapa payment gateway. |
| `FIREBASE_CONFIG` | Firebase credentials for authentication, storage, and messaging services. |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Store environment secrets securely using a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions Secrets, or Firebase Config).
