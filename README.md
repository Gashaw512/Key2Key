## ⚙️ 10. Environment Variables

To configure the system securely, the following environment variables must be defined in a `.env` file within the project root.

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the PostgreSQL or MongoDB database. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used for signing and verifying authentication tokens. |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | Cloudinary API endpoint for secure media storage and delivery. |
